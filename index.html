        <p>Hello! My name is Ramsey Khayal, and I am currently a student at the University of Iowa majoring in Business Analytics. I have a passion for data, technology, and how they shape the decisions we make every day.

            I grew up in Wheaton, Illinois, and graduated from Wheaton Warrenville South High School. During those four years, I was heavily involved in extracurriculars — I played varsity soccer all four years and was active in clubs like DECA, Key Club, and Student Council. I loved being part of a team and working toward shared goals both on and off the field.
            
            I come from a close-knit family that includes my parents, my older brother, and our goofy dog, Louis. They’ve always supported me in everything I do, from academics to athletics to now building a career in business and technology.
            
            Outside of school and work, I enjoy hiking, trying out new coffee shops, watching documentaries about innovation and entrepreneurship, and exploring new music. I am always curious and eager to learn something new!</p>
